# Python for Data Analysis: IPython, NumPy, and pandas Basics

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook designed for beginners and intermediate learners looking to explore data analysis using Python, NumPy, and pandas. Inspired by *Python for Data Analysis* by Wes McKinney, this notebook serves as a practical guide, covering key data manipulation techniques. While based on concepts from the book, this notebook is original and structured for hands-on learning.

## What’s Covered

### 1. **IPython Basics**
- Magic commands (`%timeit`, '?').
- Shortcuts and history browsing for an efficient workflow.

### 2. **NumPy Fundamentals**
- Creating, manipulating, and slicing arrays.
- Mathematical operations and performance optimization with broadcasting.
  

### 3. **pandas Essentials**
- DataFrame and Series creation, filtering, and manipulation.
- Handling missing data, merging, and joining datasets.
- Grouping
- aggregation, reshaping, and basic time series analysis will be in next notebook.

## Why This Notebook?

This notebook provides:
- A practical reference for common Python, NumPy, and pandas operations.
- Examples for handling and analyzing data efficiently.
- Explanation of each line via comment.
